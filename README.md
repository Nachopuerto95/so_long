## 📜 About Project

> So_long is a basic 2D graphical game project at 42 School. The goal is to create a simple tile-based
> game where the player can move around a map, collect items, and reach an exit to win. 

	🚀 The game uses the MiniLibX graphics library provided by the school. The project tests 
     students understanding of algorithms, graphics, input handling, and memory management in C.

> [!NOTE]  
> Because of 42 School norm requirements:
> * Each function can't have more than 25 lines of code.
> * All variables are declared and aligned at the top of each function.
> * Project should be created just with allowed functions.
